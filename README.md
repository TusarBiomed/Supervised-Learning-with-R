# Supervised-Learning-with-R
Classification methods implementation with package caret

The goal of this project is to develop classification models to predict the death of a patient in ICU with available patient data. We also apply feature selection while creating the models. At the end, we compare the accuracy of different models in training as well as in test data. 

The following methods was considered: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbours (kNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM).
